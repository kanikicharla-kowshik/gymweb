            <h2> STRENGTH TRAINING </h2>
            <h1> MASS GAIN </h1>           
            <p> Strength training involves the performance of physical exercises that are designed to improve strength and endurance. It is often associated with the lifting of weights. It can also incorporate a variety of training techniques such as bodyweight exercises, isometrics, and plyometrics. An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. It is primarily undertaken for aesthetic purposes over functional ones, distinguishing it from similar activities such as powerlifting and calisthenics.</p>

            <h1> MUSCLE GROWTH </h1>
            <p> Everyone has 6-pack abs hiding under belly fat and flab. Getting the fat off is what reveals your already flat, toned stomach. Crunches and ab workouts dont specifically target belly fat.Weight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles and so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength.</p>

            <h1> STAY HEALTHY </h1>

            <h1> HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING </h1>
            <p> High-intensity training (HIT) proposes that we can gain muscle size and strength faster and more efficiently if we keep our workouts short, infrequent, and brutally intense. Itâ€™s not the most popular way to build muscle. . As a result, high-intensity workouts are generally kept brief. After a high-intensity workout, as with any workout, the body requires time to recover and produce the responses stimulated during the workout, so there is more emphasis on rest and recovery in the HIT philosophy than in most other weight training methods.</p>

            <h1> NATURAL BODY BUILDING </h1>
            <p> Without a doubt, regular exercise can benefit your health, mind and body. Not only does it boost your energy, increase lean muscle mass, decrease your risk for certain health conditions and help you manage your weight, but it also improves your mood and enables you tSince natural bodybuilders avoid using steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, they seek to optimize their training, diet, and rest regimes to maximize natural anabolic hormone production, thereby accelerating recovery and increasing hypertrophy and strength. </p>
